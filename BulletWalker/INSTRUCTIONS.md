## Bullet Walker

### ABOUT
Result of a school assigment to create a unique mechanic for a platformer using the Unity 2D Game Kit. My idea was to incorporate the shooting mechanic of the kit into the platforming - I made the player shoot special jumpable bullets which boost the player into the air after touching them.
