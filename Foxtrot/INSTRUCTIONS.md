## Foxtrot

### ABOUT
Result of an assigment to add physics based mechanics and animations to a generic platformer. I added "ninja ropes" and fans boosting the player into the air. Because the game wasn't originally made to include a physics simulation it was necessary to understand the original code and find a way to add physics into it.

### LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS
This game was developed for the Windows operating system. After unzipping run the `Foxtrot.exe` file.

### CONTROLS
`WASD/Arrow keys` -> Move\
`Space bar` -> Jump\
`Shift` (when under a platform) -> Shoot ninja rope\
`W`,`S` or `Up arrow`,`Down arrow` (when on rope) -> Climb up or down\
`Space bar` (when on rope) -> Jump off the rope

### GOAL OF THE GAME
Play around and have fun. For a challenge try to reach the right side of the level.
